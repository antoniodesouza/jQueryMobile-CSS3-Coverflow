CSS3 Coverflow
=============

This is intended to work for Safari under iOS (right now alignment looks funny in Chrome/Safari) as near as possible like the coverflow present in itunes grabbing the images present in a DOM element (the one where the plugin will be applied) and replaces the contents of it for the coverflow.

Most of the effort have been put in the UI/graphic aspect... feel free to optimize jQuery as i will continue  to work on that :).

V.1.0
---
- It works in iOS (4.3.3) Safari in portrait mode, landscape is on progress
- CSS is static - will be fragmented into dynamic/static pieces since part of the styles works in function of the images size
- JS is in process of optimization.
